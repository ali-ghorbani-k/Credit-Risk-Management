# Credit-Risk-Management
Building an end-to-end machine learning model to predict the probability of paying back a loan by each applicant.

# Problem Statement 
This is a supervised binary classification problem since the lables are provided in the application_train table (supervsied), and the lable is a binary variable with 0 (repaying the loan) and 1 (having difficulty repaying the loan).

# Data 
I have collected the data from kaggle that was provided by [Home Credit financial institution]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data).

There are two main tables related to the current credit application:

* __application_train__: This tables includes the information for the each loan application represented by an id of loan (__SK_ID_CURR__). The applicatoin_train table includes a TARGET column (1 : client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan in our sample, 0 : the loan was repaid) 
    
* __application_test__ : This table has the same column as the application_train table, but does not have TARGET column. The TARGET column will be predicted by the           Machine     learning model and could be used in kaggle competition.
    
There are two main sources of data related to the historical data of each application 1) Bureau 2) Home Credit which are presented in following tables:

1. __Bureau__:

    1. __Bureau__ : This table includes information for all client's previous credits provided by other financial institution that were reported to Credit Bureau.
    Each credit in bureau table is represented by a bureau id (__SK_ID_BUREAU__) which is related to the one id of loan application (__SK_ID_CURR__). One SK_ID_CURR can have 
    0,1,2 or more related previous credits (SK_ID_BUREAU) in bureau table showing a one-to-many relationship.
    2. __Bureau_balance__ : This table includes information related to the monthly balance of previous credits in Credit Bureau. This table has one row for each month of         history of every previous credit reported to Credit Bureau â€“ i.e the table has (#loans in sample * # of relative previous credits * # of months where we have some history     observable for the previous credits) rows. 
    
2. __Home Credit__:

    1. __previous_application__: This table includes all previous application at Home Credit which represented by an id of loan (__SK_ID_PREV__). One SK_ID_CURR can have  
    0,1,2 or more related previous credits (SK_ID_PREV) in previous_application table showing a one-to-many relationship.
    
    2. __POS_CASH_BALANCE__: This table includes monthly balance of previous point of sale (POS) with Home Credit.
    
    3. __credit_card_balance__ : This table inlcudes monthly balance snapshots of previous credit cards that the applicant has with Home Credit
    
    4. __installments_payments__ : This table includes repayment history for the previously disbursed credits related to the loans in Home Credit database.

Description of all the columns will be found in HomeCredit_columns_description.csv which is available in the provided link.
The following Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) shows how the data is related:

# Preprocessing of data
As shown in the above ERD each SK_ID_CURR is related to multiple SK_ID_BUREAU in Bureau table and to multiple SK_ID_PREV in Home Credit tables.
In order to develop machine learning model, first we need to flatten out the database. It means aggregate the information from 2 bureau and 4 Home Credit tables to have one merged table. Each row in the final merged table represents one loan application (SK_ID_CURR). 

Three different strategies have been used in this project to analyze previous loans life cycle and flatten out the database: 

1. __Manual feature engineering__
2. __Automatic feature engineering__
3. __deep learning__
